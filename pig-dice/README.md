# _Pig Dice Game_

#### _This is an Epicodus project that takes one die that is numbered 1-6 and allows two players to roll against eachother until they reach 100. This site will use jQuery , HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a game for two players to play.The rules of the game are:_
* _If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn_
* _If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues._
* _If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn._


_Current Version March, 2020._
